My favourite film is Student of the Year. It is a Bollywood movie directed by Karan Johar. The main actors are Varun Dhawan, Alia Bhatt, and Sidharth Malhotra. This movie is special because it was the first movie for all three actors, and they acted very well. The film is full of fun, emotions, friendship, love, and competition. The story is about three students who study in a big and famous college called St. Teresaâ€™s. There is a big competition in the college called Student of the Year, Every student wants to win this trophy because it shows who is the best in studies, sports, and other activities. The three main characters are Rohan, Shanaya, and Abhimanyu. Rohan and Shanaya are already a couple, and Abhimanyu becomes their new friend. At first, they all are very close friends. They enjoy their college life together, going to parties, dancing, and having fun. But as the competition gets serious, their friendship starts to change. Both Rohan and Abhimanyu want to win the trophy. At the same time, both of them start liking Shanaya, which makes things more complicated. Their friendship turns into rivalry, and they fight because of love and competition. The movie has many great songs and dances. My favourite song is Radha because it is very lively and colourful. I also like Disco Deewane because it shows a big party scene with lots of fun and energy. The college shown in the movie looks very beautiful and modern, with big buildings and green grounds. I like this movie because it shows how friendship can be affected by love and competition. It teaches us that winning is not always the most important thing in life. Sometimes we forget about the people we care about when we try too hard to be the best. The film also shows that true friendship can last even after fights and problems. I enjoyed the acting, the songs, the colourful sets, and the story. It is a fun movie with emotions, comedy, and drama. I would recommend this film to my friends because it is entertaining and has a good message about friendship and life.
