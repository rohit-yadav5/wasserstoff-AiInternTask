🏗️ System Architecture
	•	Frontend
Chat interface with a sidebar for uploads and previews, built using modern JavaScript frameworks (React/Next.js or similar).
	•	Backend (FastAPI)
Handles requests, document operations, and RESTful API endpoints.
	•	Document Processor
	•	Chunking: Splits files into smaller parts (like paragraphs).
	•	Embedding: Converts chunks to semantic vectors using Sentence Transformers.
	•	Vector Database (ChromaDB)
Stores embeddings for fast semantic search.
	•	Clustering (KMeans)
Groups similar content to identify themes in documents.

🧠 Methodologies
	1.	Document Chunking – Files are split into manageable sections.
	2.	Semantic Embedding – Chunks are turned into meaningful vectors via Sentence Transformers.
	3.	Semantic Search – User queries are compared with vectors to retrieve relevant text.
	4.	Clustering – KMeans algorithm groups similar chunks to highlight key topics.
	5.	Citation Support – Each result is traced back to its original section (not clickable).

📝 Developer Notes

Building Sheep Bot was a challenging but rewarding experience. From integrating NLP and vector search to connecting the frontend and backend, each step came with its own learning curve. The biggest hurdle was deployment, as many of the suggested platforms weren’t suitable for my use case. With the help of an employee from my sister’s company, I finally hosted the project on a custom domain, ensuring reliable public access. This process taught me a lot about full-stack development, API integration, and cloud deployment.

🎯 Conclusion

Sheep Bot is more than just a chatbot — it’s a smart, interactive assistant that simplifies document research through AI. With features like semantic search, theme detection, and a creative UI, it brings both functionality and fun to users. Despite the initial deployment issues, the project is now live, stable, and production-ready. It’s a strong example of learning, growth, and creative problem-solving.
